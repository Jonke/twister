The purpose of this little pet project is actually not to create another syslog but to use Processing.
But since I need some data I might as well use create some way to collect the kind of data I want.

To start with I need just to get a timeline with points when something happend.

Then a map of where something happend.


Then we try to connect Processing to some kind of server so that we can monitor ceration apps, ids, or whatever when it happens.
